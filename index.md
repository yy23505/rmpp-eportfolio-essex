# Research Methods & Professional Practice – E-Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio documents my work for the **Research Methods & Professional Practice** module (MSc Computer Science, University of Essex Online).

**What you’ll find:**
- **Evidence** of completed activities (briefs, artefacts, links)
- **Reflections** (what I did, what I learned, what I’d change)
- **Outcome mapping** to module ILOs
- **Ethics** considerations and approvals (where applicable)
