# Collaborative Discussion 1 — Abusive Workplace Behavior

## e-Portfolio Activity: Collaborative Learning Discussion 1

I have selected the ACM case study **“Abusive Workplace Behavior.”**  
In this case, Max, a senior technical lead, consistently shouts at team members, withholds credit by removing their names from publications, and creates a hostile environment. When Diane reports this to management, she is dismissed and told to “grow up,” demonstrating a failure of ethical leadership and professional responsibility.

This behaviour clearly violates the **ACM Code of Ethics** (ACM, 2018).  
- **Principle 1.2 – Avoid harm** is breached due to the psychological and professional damage caused to team members.  
- **Principle 1.4 – Be fair and take action not to discriminate** applies as women on the team are disproportionately targeted.  
- **Principle 1.5 – Respect the work required to produce new ideas** is violated when Max removes authorship credit.  
- **Principle 3.3 – Manage personnel to enhance the quality of working life** is ignored by the manager who refuses to address the misconduct.

There are legal implications, particularly under the **UK Equality Act 2010**, which prohibits workplace harassment and discrimination. Recent research shows abusive supervision negatively affects mental health, productivity, and team trust (Harms et al., 2022). Socially, this behaviour reinforces toxic tech culture, discouraging diversity and marginalising underrepresented groups in computing (Kakar, 2020).

The **BCS Code of Conduct** reinforces similar values.  
- **Section 1 – Public Interest** requires respect for others’ wellbeing.  
- **Section 2 – Professional Integrity** demands fair treatment and honesty (British Computer Society, 2022).  

Both ACM and BCS emphasise that computing professionals must uphold ethical behaviour, challenge misconduct, and support a safe workplace.

## Reflection

**What?**  
This discussion highlighted how professional codes intersect with legal and social responsibilities in computing workplaces.

**So what?**  
I realised that ethical issues extend beyond technical competence; leadership behaviour directly shapes psychological safety, diversity, and innovation.

**Now what?**  
In future roles, I will proactively reference professional codes, support inclusive communication, and model ethical conduct when managing or collaborating with teams.
