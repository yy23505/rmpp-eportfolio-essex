## Discussion Topic – Case Study: Accuracy of Information

Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received a project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal, *Whizzz*. Having collected the necessary data, Abi now needs to perform the appropriate analyses and print the reports to send to the manufacturer.  

Unfortunately, the data Abi has collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate that Whizzz is harmful. Abi also realises that some other correlations could be performed that would cast Whizzz in a more favourable light. “After all,” Abi thinks, “I can use statistics to support either side of any issue.”

### Ethical Concerns

- Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study, Abi would be acting unethically.  
- But is it any more ethical for Abi to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports two or more different conclusions?  
- Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses?  
- Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results?  
- If Abi does put forward both sets of results to the manufacturer, Abi suspects that they will publicise only the positive ones. What are the other courses of action?

## Initial Post

The case of Abi highlights the ethical dilemma between professional integrity and commercial pressure. Although Abi recognises that altering data values would constitute fabrication, selectively applying statistical methods to portray the product positively is still unethical. This practice introduces bias and misleads stakeholders, violating principles of honesty, objectivity, and transparency in research (Resnik, 2020).  

According to the **ACM Code of Ethics** (ACM, 2022) and **IEEE Code of Ethics** (IEEE, 2020), professionals are required to avoid deceptive practices and ensure that their work contributes to society’s well-being.  

Abi has a moral and professional obligation to present all findings, including negative results. Selective reporting is a form of research misconduct that can have harmful consequences, especially in matters affecting public health (Ioannidis, 2019).  

Legally, providing misleading nutritional claims could breach regulations such as the **UK Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations (2008)** and the **EU General Food Law Regulation (EC No. 178/2002)**, which emphasise public safety and accurate product information.  

If Abi suspects the manufacturer may publish only the favourable results, Abi could ensure transparency by including a detailed methodology and limitations section, reporting to an ethics committee, or seeking whistleblowing protection under the **Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998** (Lewis, 2021).  

Ultimately, Abi’s responsibility extends beyond data analysis — Abi must prevent misuse of findings and uphold public trust in scientific research.

## Reflection

**What?**  
This discussion prompted me to examine how data handling decisions can alter truth and integrity in computing and research.  

**So what?**  
I realised that professional responsibility requires resisting commercial or organisational pressures that compromise accuracy or mislead stakeholders.  

**Now what?**  
In future research and data analysis, I will document methods transparently, disclose limitations, and ensure ethical review processes are followed to maintain credibility and protect public interest.
