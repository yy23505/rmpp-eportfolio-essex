# Inferential Statistics Workshop

## Overview

This unit focused on **Inferential Statistics** and the practical application of hypothesis testing using real datasets.  
Key concepts covered:
- Null and alternative hypotheses
- Significance levels and *p*-values
- Confidence intervals
- Type I and Type II errors
- t-tests, chi-square tests, and correlation analysis

Through this activity, I practised selecting appropriate tests, checking assumptions, interpreting outputs, and using spreadsheet tools for analysis.

## Reflection

Completing this workshop strengthened my understanding of inferential reasoning and statistical decision-making.  
I learned to interpret *p*-values critically, verify assumptions before testing, and communicate quantitative results in clear, evidence-based language.  
This activity directly supported my ability to evaluate research findings in later assignments.
