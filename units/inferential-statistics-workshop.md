## Overview

This unit focused on **Inferential Statistics** and the practical application of hypothesis testing techniques using real-world datasets.  
The workshop introduced methods for drawing conclusions about populations based on sample data, covering key concepts such as:
- Null and alternative hypotheses  
- Significance levels and *p*-values  
- Confidence intervals  
- Type I and Type II errors  
- T-tests, chi-square tests, and correlation analysis  

Through this activity, I developed skills in selecting appropriate statistical tests, interpreting outputs, and using spreadsheet tools for data analysis.  
The following documents include the original worksheet provided for the activity and my completed answers with calculations and interpretations.
