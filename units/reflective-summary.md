# Reflective Piece – Research Methods and Professional Practice

## Overview

This reflective piece outlines my learning journey throughout the *Research Methods and Professional Practice* (RMPP) module.  
Using Rolfe et al.’s (2001) **“What? So What? Now What?”** framework, I critically analyse my experiences, skills development, and personal growth.  
The reflection draws upon my engagement with statistical exercises, literature review and research proposal assignments, and professional-skills evaluation—demonstrating how I applied knowledge, critical thinking, and independent working in both academic and professional contexts.

## What?

Throughout the module, I completed multiple activities designed to enhance both academic and professional competencies.  
Key components included:

- Statistical exercises from Units 8 and 9 focusing on descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analysis.  
- Literature-review and research-proposal submissions requiring critical evaluation of sources, research design, and ethical considerations.  
- Professional-skills assessment, including a skills matrix, SWOT analysis, and action plan to identify strengths and areas for development.  
- Unit 10 Research-Proposal Presentation — a memorable experience when the submission portal failed just before the deadline.  
  Fortunately, the university granted an extension; I ultimately achieved a **67 % (Merit)**.  
  In hindsight, I realised my original recording lacked audio, so the extension was a blessing in disguise.

These activities collectively provided a structured approach to developing research-methods expertise, statistical-analysis skills, and reflective professional practice.

## So What?

### Statistical Analysis Skills
Initially, I felt anxious about the statistical exercises due to limited prior experience.  
Working systematically through each task improved my confidence in interpreting data and applying quantitative methods.  
I learned that statistical literacy underpins **evidence-based decision-making** and reinforces accuracy, precision, and critical thinking in professional contexts.

### Research Methods Process
The literature review and research proposal deepened my understanding of the research process.  
Critically appraising academic sources required evaluating methodological quality and relevance.  
Developing the proposal highlighted ethical issues, feasibility, and practical implementation.  
These experiences showed that research is iterative and benefits from constructive critique.

The Research-Proposal Presentation, despite its technical challenges, strengthened my **resilience and adaptability**.  
Managing stress and uncertainty under deadline pressure taught me to maintain composure and plan contingencies.

### Personal and Professional Reflection
Completing the skills matrix and SWOT analysis revealed key strengths—communication, motivation, and organisation—and areas for growth, including statistical fluency and confidence in research design.  
These insights informed an **action plan** for continuous professional development, bridging academic learning with practical improvement.

### Emotional Response
The module evoked a range of emotions: initial apprehension around statistical tasks, stress during the portal outage, and relief upon successful completion.  
Recognising and regulating these emotions helped me approach challenges strategically rather than reactively.

### Independent and Collaborative Learning
Independent work honed my self-discipline and time management, while collaborative discussions enhanced communication and teamwork.  
Balancing autonomy with cooperation mirrored the expectations of real-world professional environments.

## Now What?

The knowledge and skills gained have direct relevance for my ongoing professional and academic practice:

- **Application of Statistical Skills:** I will apply quantitative methods to evaluate training effectiveness, conduct needs analyses, and assess organisational performance.  
- **Critical Appraisal:** Techniques learned in the literature review and proposal will guide evidence-based decision-making.  
- **Resilience and Adaptability:** I plan to maintain contingency strategies and composure when managing future research or workplace projects.  
- **Personal Development:** Insights from reflection activities guide my plan to strengthen statistical literacy and seek hands-on research opportunities.  
- **Reflective Practice:** I will continue using reflection to inform decisions, encourage growth, and maintain professional integrity.

Overall, this module demonstrated that effective professional practice requires both **technical competence and reflective insight**.

## Conclusion

The *Research Methods and Professional Practice* module provided a comprehensive framework for academic learning, skills development, and reflective growth.  
Through statistical exercises, literature review, proposal writing, professional-skills evaluation, and coping with real-life challenges such as the presentation-portal failure, I enhanced my research capabilities and self-awareness.  
The experience reinforced that **reflective practice is central to professional competence**, supporting evidence-based decision-making and lifelong learning in both academic and workplace contexts.
