## Presentation Transcript

<div class="transcript-box">

This section contains the full transcript of my research proposal presentation video, submitted as part of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module assessment. It evidences my ability to communicate research aims, justify methodology, address ethics, and plan delivery.

### Slide 1: Title  
Hello, and welcome. Today, I’ll be presenting my research proposal, “The Impact of Modern Technology on Student Learning Experiences in Higher Education.”  
This presentation will cover the research problem, significance, aims and objectives, key literature, methodology, ethics, artefact development, and timeline.

### Slide 2: Introduction & Significance  
Modern digital technology has reshaped higher education. Tools such as AI support, online learning platforms, and collaborative systems have expanded access beyond traditional classrooms.  
According to Dhawan (2020), the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the move to online learning and made digital delivery a permanent feature of university teaching.  
However, while this improves flexibility and access, it also raises questions about engagement, fatigue, equity, and student well-being.  
This research is important because it asks not just “Does technology help?” but “Under what conditions does it help — and for whom?”

### Slide 3: Research Problem  
Students appreciate flexibility and accessibility in digital learning (Johnson et al., 2021), but they also report lower motivation, screen fatigue, and reduced social interaction (Selwyn, 2022; Wang, Huang and Luo, 2023).  
There are also persistent inequalities based on access to reliable devices and internet (Nguyen and Balakrishnan, 2020).  
There is still limited holistic research on how *all* these technologies together affect overall student experience in higher education post-2020.  
This project aims to address that gap.

### Slide 4: Research Question & Objectives  
**Main research question:**  
How does modern technology influence student learning experiences in higher education?  

**Objectives:**  
1. Analyse the relationship between technology use and student engagement.  
2. Identify benefits and challenges of digital learning tools.  
3. Evaluate student perceptions of online and blended learning.  
4. Recommend strategies to improve technology-enhanced learning.

### Slide 5: Key Literature  
Almeida and Simoes (2019) found that digital tools can enhance collaboration and inclusivity.  
Holmes et al. (2021) note that AI can personalise learning and provide adaptive feedback.  
Nguyen and Balakrishnan (2020), however, argue that digital inequality and cognitive overload are still major barriers.  
Martin et al. (2022) also point out that blended models improve flexibility, but not always motivation or performance.  
Overall: technology is not automatically good or bad — its impact depends on context.

### Slide 6: Critical Evaluation of Literature  
Many existing studies focus on one tool (for example, AI or VR) instead of the student’s *whole* experience.  
A lot of findings also rely on self-report, which limits reliability and generalisability (Braun and Clarke, 2021).  
Very few post-2020 studies use mixed methods with both quantitative and qualitative data.  
My proposed work helps fill that gap by combining surveys and interviews.

### Slide 7: Research Design & Methodology  
This project uses a mixed-methods design.  
**Quantitative:** an online survey for MSc students across online and on-campus delivery modes, to measure engagement, satisfaction, and perceived outcomes with technology.  
**Qualitative:** semi-structured interviews to capture deeper, personal experiences.  
This approach supports triangulation and adds depth/validity (Braun and Clarke, 2021).

### Slide 8: Data Analysis Process  
Survey data will be analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics (e.g. relationships between engagement and technology use).  
Interview data will be coded thematically using Braun and Clarke’s (2021) thematic analysis approach.  
Combining these allows both pattern-detection and lived-experience insight.

### Slide 9: Ethical Considerations & Risk  
Participants will receive clear information about the study and give informed consent.  
Data will be anonymised and stored securely in line with UK GDPR guidance (UK Data Service, 2021).  
Participation is voluntary, and withdrawal is allowed at any stage.  
Ethical approval will be sought from the University’s Research Ethics Committee before data collection.

### Slide 10: Proposed Artefact  
The project will also generate a prototype “Student Experience Evaluation Framework.”  
This framework is intended to help institutions assess how well their digital learning environments support students in practice — not just in theory.

### Slide 11: Timeline  
The planned timeline spans ~15 weeks:
- Weeks 1–3: literature review and finalising research design  
- Weeks 4–5: instrument development and ethics approval  
- Weeks 6–8: data collection (survey + interviews)  
- Weeks 9–11: analysis and validation  
- Weeks 12–14: write-up and refinement  
- Week 15: submission

### Slide 12: Conclusion  
This research aims to build a clearer picture of how technology is shaping the student learning experience in higher education.  
It will generate:  
- evidence about how students actually experience digital tools,  
- guidance for educators and university leadership,  
- and a reusable framework for evaluating technology-enhanced learning.
