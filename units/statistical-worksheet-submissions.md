# Statistical Worksheet Submissions

## Overview

This activity built on earlier work in inferential statistics by applying quantitative analysis methods to real datasets.  
The tasks focused on performing hypothesis tests, interpreting p-values, analysing correlations, and validating assumptions about normality and variance.  
These worksheets demonstrate both computational accuracy and interpretation of statistical outcomes in context.
