# Statistical Worksheet Submissions

## Overview

This activity built on earlier work in inferential statistics by applying quantitative analysis methods to real datasets.  
The tasks focused on performing hypothesis tests, interpreting p-values, analysing correlations, and validating assumptions about normality and variance.  
These worksheets demonstrate both computational accuracy and interpretation of statistical outcomes in context.

## Reflection

Completing this worksheet deepened my understanding of the link between statistical concepts and applied data interpretation.  
By running hypothesis tests and exploring significance thresholds, I strengthened my ability to distinguish between statistical and practical significance.  
Using spreadsheet tools reinforced accuracy in computation and documentation, while interpreting results in context improved my confidence in data-informed reasoning.  
This task also highlighted the importance of transparencyâ€”clearly showing all stages of analysis ensures replicability and integrity in quantitative research.
